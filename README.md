RABuffs-Edited

This is only lightly edited version of RABuffs, I did not make this addon. Added new lines for new buff checks, such as Dire Maul, Rumsey, Armor pots, Well fed and some other.

Handy way to use this is, /rabq + target + buffs + groups + classes -Target can be: /c + channel name (/c buffchannel) for example. or just 'raid' 'party', without '/c' and '/w Playername'

-Buffs can be many, I will list only ones I have added (It is keywords the addon uses to check the buffs) zgbuff Zul'Gurub Buff bandage Recently Bandaged rumsey Rumsey Rum Black squid Squid tuber Run Tum Tubber Surprise firerezprot,shadowrezprot,naturerezprot Resistance Potions wellfed Well Fed songflower Songflower dmcrit Slip'Kik's Savvy dmdmg Fengus's Ferocity armorpot Elixir of Superior Defense hppot Elixir of Fortitude dumpling Desert Dumplings nightfin Nightfin Soup mageblood Mageblood Potion drinking Who is currently drinking bronze Chromaggus Bronze Debuff

There is a list of ALL the buffs that are checkable ingame in addon, this is only the list of ones I added. These buffs I added will check who DOES NOT have it, if you want to check who DOES have them only, use 'not' infront of the buff name in the /rabq function.

-Groups Just add any numbers of groups you want to check

-Classes Warlock L Warrior W Rogue R Hunter H Priest P Mage M Shaman S Druid D Paladin L

An example, to check mongoose: /rabq raid mongoose wr Checks warriros and rogues who do not have mongoose. /rabq raid not rumsey w Checks warriors who have rumsey rum black.

Most of this above is by default in addon help if you only type /rabq, but I wrote it here too anyway.
